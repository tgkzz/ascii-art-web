# Ascii-art-web

Ascii-art-web, this is a continuation of the last task, where you had to display text using a special banner. the text turned into asky art, which looks pretty cool. The only difference is that this project is a web page, which is easier to use than using a terminal.

## Run locally

start server by cloning project, then run this command

```bash
go run .
```

after that, feel free to try different texts, banners, and download it if you like them


## Run using docker and makefile

Project is available by running using docker. To make it easier to build and run container, use next commands

```bash
make build
make run
```

project will be run using IMAGE_NAME "ascii-art-web" and CONTAINER_NAME "asd" by default. To change them, check out makefile
